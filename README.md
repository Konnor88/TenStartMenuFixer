# TenStartMenuFixer
Simple application that restores the Windows 10 start menu on Windows 11. Can be toggled on or off.

# How does it work?
It uses a command-line interface to configure a registry key that allows for the Windows 10 start menu to be displayed rather than the Windows 11 start menu.

# How can I build it?
Just open it up and press "Build" in Visual Studio and you're good to go.
